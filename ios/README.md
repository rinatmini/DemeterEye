# DemeterEye

DemeterEye is a mobile application that helps farmers monitor the health and phenology of their fields using NASA Earth observation data.  
By combining satellite vegetation indices (NDVI/EVI) with climate data, the app provides farmers with simple, actionable insights:  
- Track field greenness and seasonal growth history  
- Detect anomalies such as earlier or later starts of the growing season  
- View summaries and predictions related to crop flowering and yield potential  
- Receive notifications when the season begins earlier or later than normal  

## Features
- Login and manage multiple fields  
- Interactive map view with field boundaries  
- Seasonal summaries with start, peak, and end of season dates  
- Integration with satellite and climate data sources  

## About
This project was developed as part of the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**.  
It is a proof-of-concept tool designed to make complex NASA Earth observation datasets accessible and useful for smallholder farmers worldwide.
